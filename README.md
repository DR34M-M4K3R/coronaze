# coronaze

A text based game, in which you can do literally anything, like breaking a window with a piece of paper, or anything else. The game is about the lockdown, an apocalypse occured, and you have to survive
for the moment, you can: <br/>
- Pick up objects, put them into your hand<br/>
- listen to music
- making the narrator resign by enrolling him (yesðŸ™ƒ)
- go on a car, break the windows, to pick stuff<br/> on it.
- and other secret things ;)

## The game is not playable at all! It is in a very late stage of development. You can still run it, but the music will be missing and be careful where you walk, there is lots of bugs! :)
